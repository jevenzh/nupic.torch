# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in helping nupic.torch improve and evolve. Numenta maintains and runs this code to support ongoing research and exploration of biologically inspired ideas applied to Deep Networks. 

Before your [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) will be reviewed by our team of committers, you'll need to sign our [Contributor License](http://numenta.org/licenses/cl/).

Before considering contribution, we hope you'll try to understand the biology behind these theories. It would be a good idea to become familiar with [HTM Theory](https://numenta.org/htm-school/) and read [Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex](https://numenta.com/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex/).

## File Bugs

If you found a bug, [please report it](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.torch/issues/new) in as much detail as possible. Copy / paste of console text is better than screenshots of console logs.
